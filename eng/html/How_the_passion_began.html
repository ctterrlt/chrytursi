		<h1>My Chess Journey</h1>
		<p>
		  My passion for chess was born almost by chance, back in fifth grade.  
		  Every week, a chess instructor would come to our school to give lessons.  
		  Unlike most of my classmates, I had never played before.  
		  Yet, in no time just after the first two lessons I had become the strongest player in the class.  
		  I had beaten all my peers and started playing regularly with the instructor, even though he went quite easy on me.
		</p>

		<p>
		  Back then, my favorite checkmates were the ones using two rooks or the queen and rook combination — simple, yet highly effective.  
		  If I had to estimate my playing strength at the time, I'd say I was around <strong>650 Elo</strong>.
		</p>

		<p>
		  Despite the coach encouraging me to join a chess club and play in tournaments, I refused and completely stopped playing.  
		  For years, chess remained just a memory.
		</p>

		<p>
		  Everything changed during my first year of high school, when — thanks to TikTok bringing chess back into the spotlight —  
		  I started playing a casual game once a week with some classmates.  
		  I also took part in a school tournament, but I wasn’t very well-trained and the results weren’t great.
		</p>

		<p>
		  The real turning point came in my third year. After switching classes, I met new classmates who were much more experienced and passionate about the game.  
		  Thanks to them, I began training consistently again.  
		  Before the regional school championship, my estimated rating had risen to about <strong>1100 Elo</strong>.
		</p>

		<p>
		  Since then, I haven’t stopped. Today I keep playing and training with dedication.  
		  I take inspiration from top chess content creators like <strong>Levy Rozman</strong> (better known as <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GothamChess/videos" target="_blank" class="g">GothamChess</a></em>),  
		  several chess instructors on TikTok, and above all <strong>Candidate Master <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@redon.sheta" target="_blank" class="g">Redon Sheta</a></strong>,  
		  with whom I’ve played several live games. He has been a true mentor in my chess improvement.
		</p>

		<p>
		  What’s next? On <strong>May 25, 2025</strong>, I’ll be playing in an important tournament,  
		  facing off against several <strong>1st Category players</strong> and <strong>Candidate Masters</strong>.  
		  I feel confident and ready to give it my all.
